# JaPS
JaPS is a robust and lightweight Java Pub/Sub library which uses JSON.

I have started this project to learn myself how Pub/Sub libraries can work and it has turned out that JaPS works really well.

The publishing and subscribing of JSON messages are handled with channels. 
JaPS allows you to register handlers in which methods get invoked based on a key and value match. 
It is also possible that one handler is responsible for one channel and it's JSON messages.

**Under development**

You can already have an inside of the library in the dev branch.
